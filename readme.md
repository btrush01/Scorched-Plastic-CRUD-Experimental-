This experiment builds upon a past repository, but may not represent my vision for that final product. Thus, it made more sense to upload this as its own thing until I can decide how to better implement the CRUD concept. In its current form, I have maintained most of the front end, but introduced a simple form under an "Add-On" div that allows users to upload their own images, and provide whatever names and descriptions they want. Since it would be difficult to cover all Plastic Army Men toys, I thought this would be a fun way to let the user do it themselves.

My vision is to ultimately have user entries in "Add-On" conform to the same lightbox format and functionality as the previous hardcoded entries, as well as the option to add a "Category" option to the form that will allow users to place additions in under specific categories, (EX: Infantry, Armor), or even create entirely new ones, (EX: Air). I also want to add a better means of including custom user images, such as an "Upload Image" button. Currently, an image needs to be dragged into the project manually to be referenced. However, these goals are beyond the scope of what I can achieve at this time.

To run the project,

npm init
npm install express
npm install
npm install boddy-parser
localhost:3030
